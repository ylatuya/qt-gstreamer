 * \brief Helper class for painting video on a QGraphicsView
 *
 * This is a helper class that represents a video surface on a QGraphicsView.
 * This is not a QGraphicsItem, though, it is just a helper class to bind
 * the video sink to a specific view. To use it, create a GraphicsVideoWidget,
 * add it to your scene and connect it with this surface.
 *
 * Example
 * \code
 * QGraphicsScene *scene = new QGraphicsScene;
 * QGraphicsView *view = new QGraphicsView (scene);
 * view->setViewport(new QGLWidget); //recommended
 * QGst::Ui::GraphicsVideoSurface *surface = new QGst::Ui::GraphicsVideoSurface(view);
 * ...
 * QGst::Ui::GraphicsVideoWidget *widget = new QGst::Ui::GraphicsVideoWidget;
 * widget->setSurface(surface);
 * scene->addItem(widget);
 * \endcode
 *
 * This class internally creates and uses either a "qtglvideosink" or a "qtvideosink"
 * element. This element is created the first time it is requested and a reference is
 * kept internally.
 *
 * To make use of OpenGL hardware acceleration (using qtglvideosink), you need to set
 * a QGLWidget as the viewport of the QGraphicsView. Note that you must do this before
 * the video sink element is requested for the first time using the videoSink() method,
 * as this method needs to find a GL context to be able to construct qtglvideosink and
 * query the hardware about supported features. Using OpenGL acceleration is recommended.
 * If you don't use it, painting will be done in software with QImage and QPainter
 * (using qtvideosink).
 *
 * This class can also be used to paint video on QML.
 *
 * Example:
 * \code
 * // in your C++ code
 * QDeclarativeView *view = new QDeclarativeView;
 * view->setViewport(new QGLWidget); //recommended
 * QGst::Ui::GraphicsVideoSurface *surface = new QGst::Ui::GraphicsVideoSurface(view);
 * view->rootContext()->setContextProperty(QLatin1String("videoSurface"), surface);
 * ...
 * // and in your qml file:
 * import QtGStreamer 0.10
 * ...
 * VideoItem {
 *      id: video
 *      width: 320
 *      height: 240
 *      surface: videoSurface
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \sa GraphicsVideoWidget
